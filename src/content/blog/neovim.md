Neovim is a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim (which itself derives from Stevie). It is not a rewrite but a continuation and extension of Vim. Many clones and derivatives exist, some very clever -- but none are Vim. Neovim is built for users who want the good parts of Vim, and more.
